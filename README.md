# Deep-Neural-Networks-for-Approximating-C-SPARQL

This folder contains:
- the extended version of the paper containing an appendix with the SPARQL queries, the
indications on the final network configurations for each query, as well as the plots
of accuracy and loss for training and validation of all presented results;
- a .zip containing the event processor;
- a .zip containing everything for running the CSPARQL queries;

To run the event processor, please unzip and run the following commands using Python3:
1. parser.py
2. event_processor.py
3. FileGen.py

To test the queries, unzip, import the project into an IDE of your choice (ECLIPSE for 
example), and run Experiment.java, which contains the code for Query 7. Other queries 
can be easily substituted using the material presented in the appendix of the paper.
